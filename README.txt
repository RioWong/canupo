                        # The data file lists start after the : separator on the command line
# Note: XXX stands for the classifier type:
# - least_squares: Basic minimal least squared error hyperplane for each pair of classes
# - linear_svm: Hyperplane separating each pair of classes, but defined so as to lead to maximal margins instead of least squares
# - gaussian_svm: Gaussian kernel SVM, same principle but using the "kernel trick" to get a non-linear mapping in the original space.
